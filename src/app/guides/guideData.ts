  # Turn-Based Combat System
  
  Mythwar's turn-based combat system is one of its most distinctive features, setting it apart from real-time MMORPGs. This guide explains how the combat system works based on archived information.
  
  ## What is Turn-Based Combat?
  
  Unlike most modern MMORPGs that use real-time combat, Mythwar employs a turn-based system where:

  ### Turn Structure
  Each combat turn involves:
  1. **Planning Phase**: Players decide what actions to take
